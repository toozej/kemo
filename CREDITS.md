## Inspiration
The initial idea for this project came when I was reading [this article](https://weblog.plexobject.com/archives/6869) (and the related job-specific version) by [Shahzad Bhatti](https://github.com/bhatti/). I wanted a quick and easy way to spin up demos like this without having to copy/paste YAML files around.

## Demos
- https://weblog.plexobject.com/archives/6869

## LLMs
- ChatGPT for initial implementation and questions along the way, including the "good" and "bad" hello-world demos
- GitHub Copilot with GPT-4o for in-line help, refactoring, etc.
