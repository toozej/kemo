## Inspiration
The initial idea for this project came when I was reading [this article](https://weblog.plexobject.com/archives/6869) (and the related job-specific version) by [Shahzad Bhatti](https://github.com/bhatti/). I wanted a quick and easy way to spin up demos like this without having to copy/paste YAML files around.

## Demos
- hello-world - ChatGPT
- canary - https://medium.com/@muppedaanvesh/implementing-canary-deployment-in-kubernetes-0be4bc1e1aca

## LLMs
- ChatGPT for initial implementation and questions along the way, including the "good" and "bad" hello-world demos
- GitHub Copilot for in-line help, refactoring, etc. particularly of Tmux-related portions and helper Bash scripts
- Claude for demo-stepper script and integrating it into overall project
- Kilo Code VSCode plugin for in-line help, demo Kubernetes manifest generation, etc.
