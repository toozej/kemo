name: Labels & Selectors - Working
description: |
  Demonstrates Kubernetes labels on Pods and Service selectors (equality-based) by routing to two Deployments (v1 and v2) labeled differently. Ingress path routes (/v1, /v2) target matching Services.

tags: [labels, selectors, services, routing, nginx, networking, good]
objectives:
  - Access https://labels-selectors-good.k8s.orb.local or labels-selectors-good.k8s.mk.local/v1 and /v2 to see different backends
  - Inspect Services’ selectors and Deployments’ labels to understand routing
  - Confirm Deployments/Services/Ingress are healthy and paths resolve
observations:
  - Service labels determine which Pods receive traffic
  - Changing pod labels or service selectors reconfigures routing dynamically
