name: Endpoints - Selectorless Service with Manual Endpoints
description: |
  Demonstrates a selectorless Service with manually managed Endpoints pointing to
  in-cluster backends (two NGINX Deployments). Endpoints are generated dynamically
  at runtime by querying Pod IPs and applied after backends are ready. Traffic is
  exposed via HTTPS Ingress.

tags: [service, endpoints, endpointslices, networking, nginx, working]
objectives:
  - Deploy two backend pods (A and B) without coupling them to the Service via selectors
  - Create an Endpoints resource manually that lists backend Pod IPs on port 80
  - Access the service through HTTPS Ingress and observe routing to A/B backends
observations:
  - Service has no selector; Endpoints object determines traffic targets
  - Updating Endpoints immediately updates routing without redeploying backends
