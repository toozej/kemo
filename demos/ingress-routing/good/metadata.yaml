objectives:
  - Access https://ingress-routing-good.k8s.orb.local or ingress-routing-good.k8s.mk.local/app1 and /app2 and observe different content
  - Verify TLS termination via demo-tls and Nginx Ingress annotations
  - Confirm Deployments and Services are healthy and routes resolve
observations:
  - Ingress routes based on URL path to the correct Service
  - Pods serve content including HOSTNAME indicating which backend responded
