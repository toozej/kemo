objectives:
  - Access https://qos-classes-good.k8s.orb.local or qos-classes-good.k8s.mk.local/best-effort, /burstable, and /guaranteed to observe differences
  - Inspect requests and limits to understand how Kubernetes derives QoS class
  - Confirm Deployments/Services/Ingress are healthy and routes function
observations:
  - BestEffort: no requests/limits; lowest priority under pressure
  - Burstable: requests lower than limits; can burst above requested baseline
  - Guaranteed: requests equal limits for CPU and memory; highest eviction priority
