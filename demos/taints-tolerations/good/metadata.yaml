name: Taints and Tolerations - Working
description: |
  Demonstrates scheduling with tolerations. The Deployment tolerates a NoSchedule taint
  (key=demo, value=tainted). If a node is tainted, the pod can be scheduled onto it;
  without taints present, the pod schedules normally. An Ingress exposes the app over HTTPS.

tags: [taints, tolerations, scheduling, nginx, ingress, networking]
objectives:
  - Deploy an app with a toleration for key=demo,value=tainted,effect=NoSchedule
  - Optionally taint a node and observe scheduling behavior
  - Access the app via HTTPS Ingress
prerequisites:
  - NGINX Ingress Controller installed with TLS secret "demo-tls" (provided by this repo)
notes: |-
  Optional taint to test scheduling onto a tainted node:
    kubectl taint nodes NODE_NAME demo=tainted:NoSchedule

  Remove the taint:
    kubectl taint nodes NODE_NAME demo:NoSchedule-
