name: Volumes (ConfigMap + emptyDir) - Working
description: Demonstrates mounting a ConfigMap as static web content and an emptyDir shared between containers. NGINX serves index.html from the ConfigMap and a sidecar writes a heartbeat file into the emptyDir, visible at /runtime/heartbeat.txt.

tags: [volumes, configmap, emptyDir, sidecar, nginx, networking, good]
objectives:
  - Serve index.html from a ConfigMap volume via NGINX
  - Observe heartbeat updates written by a sidecar into an emptyDir volume
  - Access the app via HTTPS at volumes-good.k8s.orb.local or volumes-good.k8s.mk.local
observations:
  - Updating the ConfigMap would require a pod restart to change index.html
  - The heartbeat file updates live without restart because emptyDir is shared
