name: Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) - Working
description: |
  Demonstrates a Deployment with 3 replicas protected by a PDB (minAvailable: 2).
  Shows how voluntary disruptions are limited to maintain availability.

tags: [pdb, availability, disruptions, maintenance, nginx, networking, good]
objectives:
  - Observe a PDB requiring at least 2 pods available during voluntary disruptions
  - Confirm Service routes to Deployment replicas and Ingress exposes HTTPS endpoint
  - Inspect PDB status and allowed disruptions via kubectl describe
observations:
  - With replicas=3 and minAvailable=2, at most one pod can be voluntarily disrupted at a time
  - Rolling updates proceed while honoring PDB constraints
