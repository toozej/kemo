name: Probes (Liveness/Readiness/Startup) - Working
description: |
  Demonstrates Kubernetes probes with an nginx web server. A sidecar writes a readiness file causing readiness to succeed after warmup; liveness and startup probe verify ongoing health.

tags: [probes, liveness, readiness, startup, deployment, nginx, networking, good]
objectives:
  - Observe startupProbe gating liveness until nginx is up
  - See readiness become True after the sidecar creates /ready
  - Access via HTTPS at probes-good.k8s.orb.local or probes-good.k8s.mk.local
observations:
  - Pod transitions from ContainerCreating -> Running (not Ready) -> Ready
  - Liveness continues succeeding while readiness can flap if /ready is removed (not in this demo)
