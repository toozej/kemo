source: https://medium.com/@muppedaanvesh/implementing-canary-deployment-in-kubernetes-0be4bc1e1aca
tags: [canary, deployment, nginx, configmap, good]
objectives:
  - Deploy a stable and canary version of an NGINX deployment
  - Use a service to load balance traffic between the stable and canary deployments
observations:
  - Stable and canary deployments are running with different NGINX versions
  - Service routes traffic correctly to both deployments, ~30% to the canary, ~70% to the stable
