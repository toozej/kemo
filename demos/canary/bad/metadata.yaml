tags: [canary, deployment, nginx, bad]
objectives:
  - Deploy a stable and canary version of an NGINX deployment
  - Use a service to load balance traffic between the stable and canary deployments
observations:
  - Stable and canary deployments are running with different NGINX versions
  - Service routes traffic equally to both deployments due to missing canary weight annotations
