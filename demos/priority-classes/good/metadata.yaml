name: Priority Classes - Working
description: |
  Demonstrates Kubernetes PriorityClass usage with two NGINX deployments assigned different
  priorities. Exposes both via a single HTTPS Ingress with path-based routing to show the
  two versions independently.

tags: [scheduling, priorityclass, preemption, nginx, deployment, ingress, working]
objectives:
  - Create cluster-scoped PriorityClass objects (high and low)
  - Assign deployments to different priorityClassName values
  - Expose each deployment via HTTPS Ingress paths (/high and /low)
observations:
  - PriorityClass resources are visible cluster-wide (kubectl get priorityclass)
  - Deployments roll out and serve distinct pages
  - In resource pressure scenarios, high-priority pods are favored over low
