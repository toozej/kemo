tags: [containers, init, sidecar, deployment, nginx, networking, good]
objectives:
  - Observe initContainer creating initial index.html with pod/node identity
  - Verify sidecar updates heartbeat.txt and page reflects it
  - Access via HTTPS at container-types-good.k8s.orb.local or container-types-good.k8s.mk.local
observations:
  - Deployment becomes Ready after init completes
  - Heartbeat value changes over time, showing sidecar activity
